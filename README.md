Weather-app using arduino, senzors, firebase for connection, visual studio for code


#### Description
	 The Arduino reads data from the dht11 temperature and humidity sensor. It formats this data and sends it to the serial port. The WinForms app (VS) detects this data, filters it, and sends to the firebase realtime database. WebApp reads this data from the firebase and displays it to the user on a web form.
